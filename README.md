# About

Digitirider is a simple endless runner based in space. You control a ship as it navigates several transitioning terrain types such as a circluar pipe, a flat but rolling plain, and more.

This game was designed with GameMaker and intended to be a simple HTML5 game.

# Activity

This project is being created solely as a 'stress relief' project for myself and so my activity on it will be inconsistent. I will be designing it with 'learning resource' in mind for newcomers to GameMaker, however, so I will do my best to have clean and easy-to-understand code when possible.
